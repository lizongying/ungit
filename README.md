# ungit

ungit is a tool for downloading Git repositories. It allows you to download only a specific branch or tag without
downloading the entire history, resulting in faster downloads.

The inspiration for this tool comes from `degit`. Some projects recommend using `degit` to download projects, but users
in mainland China may encounter network issues. This tool effectively addresses that problem.
